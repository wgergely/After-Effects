=========================


Checks for incomplete or empty EXR files in a sequence using 'mch_exrCheck.v2.0.exe' (kindly borrowed from Farmcontrol).
Optionally removes the found invalid files.

To use drag and drop a folder containing an .EXR sequence or a single .EXR item on the batch file.

The result of the last check is saved to:
./report/incompletefiles.txt
./report/sequencecheckreport.txt
