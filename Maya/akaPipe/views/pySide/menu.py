"""
    Unfortunately, the tooltip of an action does not appear by default when the action is not in a toolbar.
    
    Implemented the solution found here
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21725119/why-wont-qtooltips-appear-on-qactions-within-a-qmenu

    Note: Another workaround would have been to use the status tip so that the 'hack' below 
    would not have been needed; however, the status bar is quite far from the template menu 
    (bottom of Maya window) so it becomes less usefull.
