        Observable class (subjects in the Observer Pattern:

        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern

        ).  Observers are held through weak references.  It is not necessary
        for observers to remove themselves from ListItem subjects when they are
        about to be destroyed (in their __del__ method).  A ListItem subject
        will clean up these zombie observers on next invocation of its
        itemChanged().

        Notification of observers can carry information with it, by passing
        optional arguments to itemChanged() notification method.  It is therefore
        possible (though not mandatory) to define an interface for a list item
        change and all its observers so that observers use the arguments in the
        callback to understand what changed in the list item.  This implies
        that all observers must implement the same interface.  The simplest use
        is to pass in no arguments to itemChanged(), in which case observers
        can perform an overall refresh.
